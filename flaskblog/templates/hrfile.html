                Petro-Canada Site {{gsa.store}}
                <p>
               
                (This is a SAMPLE checklist.  Ensure you are not going against employment standards or human rights legislation.)
                <p>
                
                <li>	RULE #1 - Use your best judgment. </li>

                <li>	GUESTS come first. They pay our wages.  Let the paperwork tasks, side conversations and the telephone wait while you serve our Guests.  If there is a concern or complaint, here are a few guidelines to follow: </il> 
                <li>	LISTEN - get the whole story from the Guest.</li>
                <li>	EMPATHIZE - put yourself in the Guest’s shoes, show genuine concern and caring. </li> 
                <li>	ACT - be fast and responsive when taking action for the Guest.</li>
                <li>	WRAP-UP – tell the Guest the next steps, what you will do, and that you value their business.</li>
                <li>	RECOVERY recommendations:</li>
                <li>	Handle complaints with a POSITIVE ATTITUDE. <li>
                <li>	Conduct yourself PROFESSIONALLY.</li>
                <li>	Surprise the complaining Guest by giving them something extra, within your Associates Guidelines on offering free products or discounts for Complaint recovery.</li>
                <li>	It may not be always necessary to offer recovery funds for every complaint.  You can use your best judgment to offer the Guest one of the items approved by the Associate.</li>

                <li>	SECURITY is a top priority.  Cash in the till drawers will be kept to a minimum; drop as often as needed.  Do not have any denominations larger than $20.00 in your drawer. </li>
                <li>	The midnight Employee is NOT to leave the building unless there is an emergency situation. There are no exceptions.  Day and afternoon shift should never have more than $100.00 in the till, and midnight should never have more than $50.00. </li>

                <li>	TELEPHONE etiquette is very important. Always answer the phone with a SMILE in the following manner: </li> 
                <li>	“Good morning / afternoon / evening, 00396 Petro-Canada, Amritpal Kaur.” How can I help you? Do not deviate from this format.</il>

                <li>	SAFETY EQUIPMENT will be explained and you will need to know the location of all fire extinguishers, first aid kit, spill kit, emergency shut off switches and the location of the site’s Emergency Response Manual including all MSDS sheets. </li>

                <li>	EMERGENCY NUMBERS will be explained and emergency policies must be adhered to for the protection of you, our Guests and Suncor Energy assets. </li>

                <li>	SAFETY AT THE PUMPS includes turning off ignitions while refuelling, no smoking around the pumps and using approved CSA or ULC jerry cans only.  Rental jerry cans are NOT available.</li>

                <li>	STAFF PURCHASES are to be rung in prior to consuming products and you will need to keep your receipt for review. No tabs allowed, all purchases must be paid for immediately.</li>

                <li>	STAFF SMOKING is only permitted in the designated area.</li>
                <li>	PETS are not allowed in the store with the exception of Guide dogs.</li>
                <li>	RETURN POLICY- everything is 100% refundable.  However, returns over $7.00 must have manager’s authorization.  Be wary of sunglasses, cameras, suntan lotion, batteries and other high-ticket items coming back for refund.  These are popular scams for return and theft.</li>

                <li>	SHOPLIFTING - if the offender is an adult, we will call the police and lay criminal charges.  If the offender is a minor, we will ask the child to stay and call the parents to discuss the situation and ask how they would like things handled.  </li> 

                <li>	TELEPHONE calls to and from friends and family while on shift are not permitted. Only emergency calls are allowed.</li>

                <li>	ATTEMPT to falsify company records; i.e., cash out reports, counts, or end of day reporting is cause for termination.</li>

                <li>	CONSUMPTION of alcohol or illegal drugs while on site and buying or selling of such material will be cause for immediate termination.</li>

                <li>	READING is not permitted on site unless it is related to the job.</li>

                <li>	DISCLOSURE of sensitive information such as sales figures, gas volume and site targets is strictly prohibited. Disclosure of this data is cause for termination. </li>

                <li>	LARGE BILLS such as $50 or $100 are to be dropped in the safe immediately after receiving. More than four $20 dollar bills are to be skimmed and dropped as well. This is extremely important for Robbery Prevention.</li>

                <li>	SITE OPERATING PROCEDURES are the foundation of Suncor Energy’s training and will assist you in the development of your job. These procedures are updated regularly. </li>

                <li>	UNIFORMS must be worn when on shift and shirts must be TUCKED in. Shirts and nametags will be provided. You will need BLACK cotton/poly blend pants and black comfortable shoes. Jeans are not allowed.</li>

                <li>	KEYS are assigned as needed and must be put back in their place when you are finished with them.</li>

                <li>	PAYPOINT etiquette is very important.
                <ul>
                <li>1	NEVER talk with other Employees while Guests are waiting in line. 
                </li>
                <li>2	ALWAYS put down the phone to serve a Guest who is waiting in line.
                </li>
                <li>3	NEVER talk inappropriately or use profane language while working on shift.
                </li>
                <li>4	ALWAYS wear the approved uniform and nametag while working on shift.
                </ul>
                <li>	ASK your employer questions if you are unsure of any aspect of safety and security with your job.  It is your responsibility to comply with legislation. </li>

                <p> During your training period, you will learn more about these policies.
                </p>

                </div>


            <p>Purpose:  This site operating procedure (SOP) outlines the proper use of a Petro-Points card by any site Employee applying for this card.  The site Employee must sign at the bottom of this form to acknowledge he/she has read and understands the contents of this form.
            </p><br/>
            <li>	Site Staff may apply for a personal Petro-Points card for accumulation of points on PERSONAL PURCHASES ONLY. 
            </li>
            <li>	If a Guest, who is not collecting Petro-Points, offers Site Staff the points from their purchase, the Employee is NOT TO ACCEPT THE GUEST'S POINTS, AS THIS IS DEEMED TO BE A FRAUDULENT USE OF THE EMPLOYEE’S PETRO-POINTS CARD.
            </li>
            <li>	SITE STAFF IS NOT ENTITLED TO COLLECT PETRO-POINTS ON PURCHASES WHERE A GUEST DOES NOT PRESENT A PETRO-POINTS CARD, AS THIS IS DEEMED TO BE A FRAUDULENT USE OF THE STAFF EMPLOYEE’S PETRO-POINTS CARD.
            </li>
            <li>	Suncor Energy monitors Petro-Points usage.  Any Site Staff who uses their personal Petro-Points card fraudulently (on purchases other than their own) will have their Petro-Points card permanently revoked. 
            </li>
            <li>	Suncor Energy has zero tolerance for fraudulent use of Petro-Points by any Employee.
            </li>
            <li>	Facilitation of inappropriate or fraudulent use of Petro-Points for personal or Guest benefit will result in disciplinary action and may be deemed as grounds for dismissal.
            </li>
            <li>	The practice of keeping Guest Petro-Points cards on site is prohibited. Any cards currently at the site or in the possession of a Site Staff member must be immediately returned to protect against their fraudulent use.
            </li>
            <li>	The Instant enrollment program is for the exclusive use of Guests. The fictitious completion and subsequent use of collecting and redeeming points is considered fraudulent use of a Petro-Points card. Site staff found participating in this activity will expose themselves to disciplinary action and possible dismissal, as well as their Associate to chargebacks.
            </li><br/>

            <p>I have read and understand my role in complying with this required action sheet for personal use of Petro-Points cards.

                <div>Purpose:  this SOP is a reminder that strict adherence with Canada's competition laws is mandatory and that non-compliance with the Competition Act may result in serious monetary and criminal penalties to you and your staff.  The Act is designed to protect and promote competition and ensure a marketplace which benefits consumers.

Furthermore, the Act specifies that the individuals involved may be personally liable to fines and terms of imprisonment; for example, a term of imprisonment of up to 14 years and/or a fine of up to $25 million for an offence under the provisions relating to arrangements between competitors and anti competitive conspiracies.

                </li>
                <li>	DON'T ARGUE - once the robbery has started it's too late for robbers to change their minds.
                </li>

                </li>

        <div class = "hrheader">How Best to Protect Your Property</div><br/>

        <p>Clean and well lit premises will alter criminal activity'. Bright lights are a self-protection measure. Nothing deters robbers and burglars more than having to operate in bright light.
        </p>

            <ul class = "a">
                <li>Lights
                </li>
                <ul>
                <li>•	The ideal situation - both from a security standpoint and for customer appeal - would be to flood your whole business premises in a sea of light.
                </li>
                <li>•	The areas which are most vulnerable to the criminal and, therefore, should receive special lighting attention are:
                </li></ul>
                <ul>
                <li>	Entrances - all entry points.
                </li>
                <li>	The yard.
                </li>
                <li>	Rear of the building.
                </li>
                <li>	Office - night light inside the building and over the safe.
                </li></ul>
                <li>Locks 
                </li>
                <p>Good locks will deter many potential break & enter (B&E) efforts'.
                </p><br/>
                <p>Break & Enter (B&E): is the unlawful entry into a premise for the purpose of committing an offence (usually theft or damage to property). This ONLY occurs in a site that is closed, i.e. a non 24 hr. site. Entry into a locked room such as an office or locked or open vehicle is NOT a Break in but a theft.
                </p><br/>
                <ul><li>•	Install one inch deadbolt locks on all outside doors, and double cylinder, long-throw deadbolts on doors with glass panels.
                </li>
                <li>•	Control of keys is important.
                </li>
                <li>•	Make sure padlocks are solidly mounted and never left open - even on an open door. This practice will prevent key duplication.
                </li>
                <li>•	Change locks when a key is lost.
                </li>
                <li>•	Don't lock a burglar inside when you leave. Inspect all closets, washrooms and other hiding places before locking your business up.
                </li></ul>


                <li>Doors 
                </li>
                <ul><li>•	Metal lining on exterior doors resists drilling and sawing.
                </li>
                <li>•	Bars in the inside of doors prevent breaking the entire door and thus easy entry.
                </li>
                <li>•	Check door frames for looseness, rotting, or expansion capabilities
                </li>
                <li>•	Install non-removable hinge pins on doors that swing outward
                </li>
                <li>•	Routinely ensure that all doors are locked at closing time.
                </li>
                <li>•	ALL 24 hr. self service locations MUST have the main entrance electronically controlled by means of a magnetic or striker type lock mechanism activated from the area of the point of sale 
                </li></ul>

                <li>Windows 
                </li>Windows should offer light, ventilation and visibility. Not easy access.
                <ul><li>•	Check window frames for looseness or rotting, and that the window locks work.
                </li>
                <li>•	All windows should be clear of obstruction, to allow for clear visibility into and out of the building.
                </li></ul>
                
                <li>Alarms 
                </li>
                <p>For sites that operate less than 24 hrs a day, "An adequate alarm system provides constant attention".
                </p><br/>
                <ul><li>•	Alarms have a psychological value - they may scare the burglar or robber away. However, the installation of an alarm system can be expensive; the potential worth of an alarm system should be governed by the size of the inventory, location of the business, and the availability of local law enforcement people to answer the alarm.
                </li>
                <li>•	If your site has a history of Break ins, consideration should be given to a “cellular back up” alarm that will transmit the alarm even if telephone lines are cut.
                </li>
                <li>•	You might get a lower insurance rate if an alarm system is installed.
                </li>
                <li>•	Advertise that your station is equipped with an alarm.
                </li>
                <li>•	Ensure that all your staff are properly trained in alarm procedures. This will eliminate false alarms.
                </li></ul>
                
                <li>Cash Registers / SAFES 
                </li><ul>
                <li>•	Minimize cash on hand with frequent, irregular safe drops
                </li>
                <li>•	All sites must now have 3  safe compartments, 2 of which have time delay opening (each with a MINIMUM 2 minute delay ) they are :
                </li>
                <li>•	1 -An approved time delay opening, drop safe is now mandatory at all sites
                </li>
                <li>•	2 - All sites MUST have a time delay “coin” safe or compartment for the storage of coin, small bills, lottery and the like. ALL staff members MUST have access to the “coin” safe. It is strongly recommended that no more than $500 in small bills or coin be kept in this safe.  This safe MUST be kept locked at all times when not in immediate use. Hiding money is NOT permitted under any circumstances.
                </li>
                <li>•	3 - All sites MUST now have a  “Cash In Transit” safe for use should the site opt for armoured car cash pick up. If the site does not opt for CIT, the compartment may be used to store other valuable items.
                </li>
                <li>•	 ALL safes must be securely anchored to the floor, wall, other solid structure or millwork and located as close to the Paypoint as possible.
                </li>
                <li>•	Strictly limit the number of people having access to the keys or the safe combination for the primary drop and CIT safes. In British Columbia and Saskatchewan when a GSA is working alone after 11PM, these keys and/or combination for the drop and CIT safes must NOT be available.
                </li>
                <li>•	After store hours, leave empty cash drawers open. This will prevent unnecessary damage from a burglar hunting for cash
                </li></ul>

                <li>These are recommended MAXIMUM amounts for Safe Drops and Cash Floats. Feel free to ‘drop’ smaller amounts. With the new “Coin safes” your site should be able to operate using lower amounts, please consider it for security and safety reasons.
                </li><ul>
                <li>•	Safe Drop - Day - $100.00
                </li>
                <li>•	Safe Drop - Night - $50.00
                </li>
                <li>•	Cash Float - $75.00
                </li></ul>

                <li>Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) 
                </li>
                <p>Each location should have a closed circuit television (CCTV) system. The objectives of such a system are:
                </p><br/><ul>
                <li>•	To deter a criminal.
                </li>
                <li>•	To capture an image of the criminal, should an incident occur.
                </li>
                <li>•	A CCTV system includes cameras (both internally and externally), monitors, and a DVR in a locked office or container.
                </li>
                <li>•	There are recommended specifications for the quantity and location of equipment at each size of store.
                </li>
                <li>•	Ensure that your DVR is recording and saving at least 30 days of footage.  If there are any issues with it contact your service provider for technical support.

                <li>Theft Preventive Measures
                </li>
                <p>Theft: is the removal of property from its lawful owner without his/her consent and WITHOUT the use of a weapon, force or threat.
                </p><br/>
                <p>Theft can occur in various ways, ranging from bad cheques, use of stolen credit cards, card skimming, shoplifting, fuel theft (drive-off) occurrences and internal thefts (cash, inventory, etc.) This section will attempt to outline preventative measures against the various forms of theft.
                </p><br/>
                <p>Fuel Theft (Drive-off):  Driving away from the pump without paying is theft. 
                </p><br/>
                <p>In an accidental fuel theft (drive-off), the person believes they have paid for the transaction, but the transaction is incomplete. In an intentional fuel theft (drive-off), the person knows they are committing a crime, but feels there is little risk.
                </p><br>
                <p>The following measures can be taken to help reduce the incidence of this type of crime.
                </p><br/>

                <li>Fuel Theft (Drive-off) Prevention Measures 
                </li><ul>
                <li>•	Stay Alert. Maintain high visibility to pump island and driveways.
                </li>
                <li>•	Pay special attention to those Guests who approach the far pumps, especially when the station is busy.
                </li>
                <li>•	Make eye contact with the Guest when activating pumps and/or greet Guest at Paypoint. Being visible to all Guests and greeting them will discourage theft.
                </li>
                <li>•	Monitor the pump island for CRIND confusion. Guests may be uncomfortable with the CRIND and may not know if they have correctly completed a transaction. If they are confused or frustrated, they are your potential accidental fuel theft (drive-off) thief.
                </li>
                <li>•	Use intercom at self-serve, if appropriate, to help Guests having problem with the CRIND.
                </li></ul>

                <li>Fuel Theft (Drive-off) thief characteristics
                </li><ul>
                <li>•	The fuel thief will wait until the Paypoint operator is busy with other Guests on the site.
                </li>
                <li>•	The thief will usually drive up to the pumps which are furthest away from the view of Paypoint operator.
                </li>
                <li>•	The license plate on the car may be covered with a rag or black plastic garbage bag, which is partially sticking out from the closed trunk of the car. The plates could also be muddied to obscure the numbers.
                </li>
                <li>•	The thief may appear nervous, frequently glancing at the Paypoint operator to make sure they are not being given any special attention while at the pumps
                </li></ul>    
                
                <li>When a Fuel Theft (Drive-off) occurs 
                </li><ul>
                <li>•	DO NOT under any circumstances chase after the vehicle.
                </li>
                <li>•	Attempt to get the license number.
                </li>
                <li>•	Get a full description of the vehicle and the operator.
                </li>
                <li>•	Note the time and direction the vehicle left the lot.
                </li>
                <li>•	Obtain names and addresses of witnesses (if possible).
                </li>
                <li>•	Immediately call the police
                </li></ul>

                <li>Shoplifting
                </li>
                <p>Shoplifting, in other words, is simply someone trying to take something from the store without actually paying for it.  In most cases, it is something easily concealed in a pocket or the like and is of limited value.  
                </p><br/>
                <p>I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you do NOT attempt to apprehend or detain the suspect. Should you do so, you not only do you put yourself at risk physically should the person become aggressive, you also put yourself at risk of being sued or worse should you be mistaken and / or injure/ assault the suspect in some way.
                </p><br/>
                <p>I recommend that if you observe someone hiding something on their person and they attempt to leave the store, you verbally (from behind the counter or from a safe distance) ask them if they have forgotten to pay for something. As with fuel theft (drive-offs), never chase or physically confront the thief. If the item taken is of some value or the suspect is a repeat offender, attempt to get a good description of the person, vehicle etc, retain the video footage and contact the police. Again NEVER chase or physically confront the suspect.
                </p><br/>
                <p>Conclusion
                </p><br/>
                <p>This booklet provides many ideas and suggestions on how to protect your business and your staff from the criminal. It is primarily designed to set you thinking about the problem of crime prevention and encourage you to take positive action toward formulating an effective crime prevention program for your business. 
                </p><br/>

                <p>Asking questions like these is only the beginning. The right answers to these questions are evident in an effective program of crime prevention. Start today, work at it, improve it, and every day ask the question, "Can 1 do more?" You'll be glad you did.

                <p>Purpose:  This site operating procedure (SOP) gives a detailed account of the new regulation requiring health and safety awareness training for every worker and supervisor under Ontario’s Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA). The regulation comes into force July 1, 2014, allowing workplace parties the time to prepare. 
                </p><br/>
                <p>Beginning July 1, 2014, employers in Ontario must ensure that all their workers and supervisors complete a basic occupational health and safety awareness training program.  Besides these new requirements, employers continue to have on-going duties under the OHSA to inform workers about workplace-specific hazards. These include the general duty to “provide information, instruction and supervision to a worker to protect the health or safety of the worker.

Greeting a guest is as simple as saying hello as they walk through the door. This accomplishes two things. First, we are welcoming them. Second, the eye contact can be enough to deter a shoplifter.

                            <li>1.	A ‘Drive off’ is a kind of theft where an individual fills up the vehicle with gas and then drives away without paying for the fuel. These incidents can occur during the day or night.  Never chase after or confront in any way someone planning or doing a ‘drive-off”.  
                            </li>
                            <li>2.	Stay far away from the vehicle and if you are inside the store, do not go outside.
                            </li>
                            <li>3.	 If you are inside and can see and safely record the license plate of the vehicle – do so.  If not, try to remember and then record a description of the vehicle, e.g., colour, make, model, distinguishing features such as decals, dents or damage.
                            </li>
                            <li>4.	Fill out the drive off from found in the site actions and communications binder.
                            </li>
                            <li>5.	As soon as possible, once the ‘drive-off’ vehicle has left the site, call the police and provide the information you recorded.
                            </li>
                            <li>6.	Notify management as soon as possible so that they can retrieve security footage for the police.

                            <li>7.	Night shifts should be turning the pumps over to pre pay mode at midnight and returning the pumps to regular pay mode at about 5:00 am. This change can be made as follows: Select Menu, then Attendant Activities then Store Operation Mode. Once in store operations mode use the down arrow to move the cursor to pump 1. Hit the Y key. This turns pump 1 over to pre pay mode. Follow these steps for all  pumps then hit F10 to exit. Save changes. You are now in pre pay mode and have total control over the sale of fuel. Use the pay window to perform all transactions. If you do not have a pay window then you will have to let the guest into the store to prepay. Do this one guest at a time.
                            </li>
                            <li>8.	The night shift employee should be locking the door. You do not have to let anyone in the store.  Remember, you are in control of the store at night. Do not let someone into the store if you are concerned for your safety. 
                            </li>
                            <li>9.	You may have to use the intercom to communicate with guests. Use the phrase “Excuse me pump (), We are on prepaid hours. I need you to hang up the nozzle and pre pay at the pump or in the store first please. Thank you.”
                            </li>
                            <li>Drive off’s are a form of theft. The GSA is not financially responsible for a theft. This does not excuse a GSA from performing their duties. Forgetting to ask if the customer had gas is a failure of the GSA to perform their duties and may result in disciplinary actions.

                            <li>Preventing robberies
                            </li><ul>
                            <li>1.	Make the store attractive to Guests, unattractive to robbers:
                            </li>
                            <li>•	Keep the store clean, tidy, and well-lit.
                            </li>
                            <li>•	Keep active and alert. Don’t be a target.
                            </li>
                            <li>•	Get away from the sales counter when there are no Guests.
                            </li>
                            <li>2.	Ensure the sales counter is clearly visible from outside the store. A cash register location that is difficult to see clearly from the street helps a robbery to happen unnoticed. 
                            </li>
                            <li>3.	Keep alert at all times. 
                            </li><ul>
                            <li>•	Identify your escape routes
                            </li>
                            <li>•	Know the location of phones or assistance outside the premises.
                            </li>
                            <li>•	Be aware of areas with poor lighting.
                            </li>
                            <li>•	Avoid looking directly at suspicious loiterers. Prolonged eye-to-eye contact, especially if there is a group involved, may be seen as a challenge and possibly escalate the situation. Fill out a description sheet. If the loiterers don’t leave, call the police and ask for a patrol check.
                            </li></ul>
                            <li>4.	Greet everyone who enters the store.

                            <li>•	Be friendly and briefly look directly into their eyes.
                            </li>
                            <li>•	Ask the Guest ahead of someone suspicious, “Are you together?” The Guest will usually turn around to look at the person. This may deter the robber.
                            </li></ul>
                            <li>5.	Keep the cash register fund to a minimum: 
                            </li><ul>
                            <li>•	Remove all $50 and $100 bills from the cash register as soon as you receive them.
                            </li>
                            <li>•	Post signs advising “Minimum cash kept on premises.”
                            </li>
                            <li>•	Ask Guests for exact change or the smallest bills possible.  
                            </li></ul>
                            <li>6.	Take extra precautions after dark and during slow periods: 
                            </li><ul>
                            <li>•	Check each night to see that outside lights are on and working.
                            </li>
                            <li>•	Operate only one register late at night through early morning.
                            </li>
                            <li>•	Open the empty unused register drawer and tip it up for display.
                            </li>
                            <li>•	Run an “empty register” — just $5 bills and change. 
                            </li></ul></ul>

                            <li>1.	Remain cool and calm, and handle the entire procedure as if you were making a sale to a Guest. Most robberies last under two minutes. The longer the robbery takes, the more nervous the robber becomes, so keep it short and smooth.
                            </li>
                            <li>2.	Listen carefully to what the robbers say, and obey them. Don’t be a hero.

                            <li>•	Don’t fight. Don’t use weapons. Don’t jeopardize your own safety or that of other workers.
                            </li>
                            <li>•	Give the robbers all the cash and merchandise they want.

                            <li>•	Don’t delay or argue.

                            <li>3.	Tell the robbers of any possible surprises:

                            <li>•	Tell the robbers if you must reach for something or move in any way. Ask them for their directions.

                            <li>•	Tell the robbers if another employee is in the back room so they are not startled.

                            <li>4.	Continue to remain cool and calm.

                            </li>•	Be careful not to stare or fix your gaze too long on the robbers, but observe what they look like, what they are wearing, their size, and the type and colour of weapons. Listen carefully to what they say.
                            <li></li>
                            <li>•	Note the robbers’ exact height against the height strip as they exit.
                            </li>
                            <li>•	Immediately after the robbers have left, record appearance, mannerisms, and any distinguishing characteristics on the description sheet.
                            </li><ul>
                            <li>5.	Do not chase the robber.

                            <li>4.	When making deposits with a co-worker or trusted friend, have him or her face the other way to keep an eye on everything while you make the deposit.

                            <li>2.	We have a night call sheet for the night staff. Every other hour you call the store identified on the call sheet. The GSA at the other store will call you on alternating hours. If you cannot contact the employee at the other store then follow the instructions on the call sheet. That is, we need you to try and communicate with the manager of the other location first, then your manager. If you cannot contact the manager then you are to call the ARL Terry Futher. His phone number is on the night call sheet. Last but not least, call the police. But please ensure that you have exhausted all efforts to contact the store before calling the police. Thank you.

                            </p><br/>
                            <p>Ontario Workplace violence and workplace harassment are now recognized in the Occupational Health and Safety Act. (OHSA or the ACT). The amendments became law June 15, 2010.
                            </p><br/>
                            <p>Workplace harassment means engaging in a course of vexatious comment or conduct against a worker in a workplace that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome.
                            </p><br/>
                            <p>Workplace violence means
                            </p><br/>
                            <ul>
                            <li>•	The exercise of physical force by a person against a worker, in a workplace, that causes or could cause physical injury to the worker.
                            </li>
                            <li>•	An attempt to exercise physical force against a worker, in a workplace, that could cause physical injury to the worker.
                            </li>
                            <li>•	A statement or behaviour that it is reasonable for a worker to interpret as a threat to exercise physical force against the worker, in a workplace, that could cause physical injury to the worker.
                            </li></ul>
                            <br/>
                            <p>1.	Violence and or Harassment of co-workers will not be tolerated in the workplace.
                            </p><br/>
                            <p>2.	We will investigate and deal with incidents or complaints within 72 hours of the date that a complaint has been filed. Within reason. Employees who feel that they have suffered violence or harassment in the workplace need to put the complaint in writing. It must be signed and dated then dropped into the safe.
                            </p></br/>
                            <p>3.	Complaints that are not put in writing and signed will not be addressed. Neither will gossip. Gossip is deemed to be the worst case of harassment as it has no origin, is generally not based on facts and creates damage in the workplace that is difficult to contain and control. Gossip will not be tolerated.
