Required Action Policies Checklist
Effective Date:  January 3, 2016

<p class = "hrp">
Petro-Canada Site {{gsa.store}}
<p>
<p class = "hrp">
(This is a SAMPLE checklist.  Ensure you are not going against employment standards or human rights legislation.)
<p>
<div class = "hrp">
<li>	RULE #1 - Use your best judgment. </li>

<li>	GUESTS come first. They pay our wages.  Let the paperwork tasks, side conversations and the telephone wait while you serve our Guests.  If there is a concern or complaint, here are a few guidelines to follow: </il> 
<li>	LISTEN - get the whole story from the Guest.</li>
<li>	EMPATHIZE - put yourself in the Guest’s shoes, show genuine concern and caring. </li> 
<li>	ACT - be fast and responsive when taking action for the Guest.</li>
<li>	WRAP-UP – tell the Guest the next steps, what you will do, and that you value their business.</li>
<li>	RECOVERY recommendations:</li>
<li>	Handle complaints with a POSITIVE ATTITUDE. <li>
<li>	Conduct yourself PROFESSIONALLY.</li>
<li>	Surprise the complaining Guest by giving them something extra, within your Associates Guidelines on offering free products or discounts for Complaint recovery.</li>
<li>	It may not be always necessary to offer recovery funds for every complaint.  You can use your best judgment to offer the Guest one of the items approved by the Associate.</li>

<li>	SECURITY is a top priority.  Cash in the till drawers will be kept to a minimum; drop as often as needed.  Do not have any denominations larger than $20.00 in your drawer. </li>
<li>	The midnight Employee is NOT to leave the building unless there is an emergency situation. There are no exceptions.  Day and afternoon shift should never have more than $100.00 in the till, and midnight should never have more than $50.00. </li>

<li>	TELEPHONE etiquette is very important. Always answer the phone with a SMILE in the following manner: </li> 
<li>	“Good morning / afternoon / evening, 00396 Petro-Canada, Amritpal Kaur.” How can I help you? Do not deviate from this format.</il>

<li>	SAFETY EQUIPMENT will be explained and you will need to know the location of all fire extinguishers, first aid kit, spill kit, emergency shut off switches and the location of the site’s Emergency Response Manual including all MSDS sheets. </li>

<li>	EMERGENCY NUMBERS will be explained and emergency policies must be adhered to for the protection of you, our Guests and Suncor Energy assets. </li>

<li>	SAFETY AT THE PUMPS includes turning off ignitions while refuelling, no smoking around the pumps and using approved CSA or ULC jerry cans only.  Rental jerry cans are NOT available.</li>

<li>	STAFF PURCHASES are to be rung in prior to consuming products and you will need to keep your receipt for review. No tabs allowed, all purchases must be paid for immediately.</li>

<li>	STAFF SMOKING is only permitted in the designated area.</li>
<li>	PETS are not allowed in the store with the exception of Guide dogs.</li>
<li>	RETURN POLICY- everything is 100% refundable.  However, returns over $7.00 must have manager’s authorization.  Be wary of sunglasses, cameras, suntan lotion, batteries and other high-ticket items coming back for refund.  These are popular scams for return and theft.</li>

<li>	SHOPLIFTING - if the offender is an adult, we will call the police and lay criminal charges.  If the offender is a minor, we will ask the child to stay and call the parents to discuss the situation and ask how they would like things handled.  </li> 

<li>	TELEPHONE calls to and from friends and family while on shift are not permitted. Only emergency calls are allowed.</li>

<li>	ATTEMPT to falsify company records; i.e., cash out reports, counts, or end of day reporting is cause for termination.</li>

<li>	CONSUMPTION of alcohol or illegal drugs while on site and buying or selling of such material will be cause for immediate termination.</li>

<li>	READING is not permitted on site unless it is related to the job.</li>

<li>	DISCLOSURE of sensitive information such as sales figures, gas volume and site targets is strictly prohibited. Disclosure of this data is cause for termination. </li>

<li>	LARGE BILLS such as $50 or $100 are to be dropped in the safe immediately after receiving. More than four $20 dollar bills are to be skimmed and dropped as well. This is extremely important for Robbery Prevention.</li>

<li>	SITE OPERATING PROCEDURES are the foundation of Suncor Energy’s training and will assist you in the development of your job. These procedures are updated regularly. </li>

<li>	UNIFORMS must be worn when on shift and shirts must be TUCKED in. Shirts and nametags will be provided. You will need BLACK cotton/poly blend pants and black comfortable shoes. Jeans are not allowed.</li>

<li>	KEYS are assigned as needed and must be put back in their place when you are finished with them.</li>

<li>	PAYPOINT etiquette is very important.
<ul>
<li>1	NEVER talk with other Employees while Guests are waiting in line. </li>
<li>2	ALWAYS put down the phone to serve a Guest who is waiting in line.</li>
<li>3	NEVER talk inappropriately or use profane language while working on shift.</li>
<li>4	ALWAYS wear the approved uniform and nametag while working on shift.</li>
</ul>
<li>	ASK your employer questions if you are unsure of any aspect of safety and security with your job.  It is your responsibility to comply with legislation. </li>

Required Action Sheet for Personal Petro-Points Card
Effective Date:  April 1, 2016
Last Reviewed by Owner:  April 1, 2016

Purpose:  This site operating procedure (SOP) outlines the proper use of a Petro-Points card by any site Employee applying for this card.  The site Employee must sign at the bottom of this form to acknowledge he/she has read and understands the contents of this form.

•	Site Staff may apply for a personal Petro-Points card for accumulation of points on PERSONAL PURCHASES ONLY. 
•	If a Guest, who is not collecting Petro-Points, offers Site Staff the points from their purchase, the Employee is NOT TO ACCEPT THE GUEST'S POINTS, AS THIS IS DEEMED TO BE A FRAUDULENT USE OF THE EMPLOYEE’S PETRO-POINTS CARD.
•	SITE STAFF IS NOT ENTITLED TO COLLECT PETRO-POINTS ON PURCHASES WHERE A GUEST DOES NOT PRESENT A PETRO-POINTS CARD, AS THIS IS DEEMED TO BE A FRAUDULENT USE OF THE STAFF EMPLOYEE’S PETRO-POINTS CARD.
•	Suncor Energy monitors Petro-Points usage.  Any Site Staff who uses their personal Petro-Points card fraudulently (on purchases other than their own) will have their Petro-Points card permanently revoked. 
•	Suncor Energy has zero tolerance for fraudulent use of Petro-Points by any Employee.
•	Facilitation of inappropriate or fraudulent use of Petro-Points for personal or Guest benefit will result in disciplinary action and may be deemed as grounds for dismissal.
•	The practice of keeping Guest Petro-Points cards on site is prohibited. Any cards currently at the site or in the possession of a Site Staff member must be immediately returned to protect against their fraudulent use.

Competition Law
Effective Date:  May 30, 2014
Last Reviewed by Owner:  September 1, 2015

Purpose:  this SOP is a reminder that strict adherence with Canada's competition laws is mandatory and that non-compliance with the Competition Act may result in serious monetary and criminal penalties to you and your staff.  The Act is designed to protect and promote competition and ensure a marketplace which benefits consumers.


Suncor takes very seriously the need to ensure that all its employees and Associates comply with Canadian competition laws at all times. Failure to comply with the Competition Act in Canada may result in heavy fines, adverse publicity and civil suits by customers or suppliers seeking substantial damages. Furthermore, the Act specifies that the individuals involved may be personally liable to fines and terms of imprisonment; for example, a term of imprisonment of up to 14 years and/or a fine of up to $25 million for an offence under the provisions relating to arrangements between competitors and anti competitive conspiracies.

Commitments and Responsibilities 
From the Competition Act…	Suncor’s Commitment	Associate's Responsibility
To reference only the most serious matters, it is a criminal offence to get into any kind of arrangement (written or verbal) with competitors, which includes other Associates, suppliers or customers for any of the following:
•	To fix prices 
•	To restrict the supply of products
•	To divide up customers or markets
•	To agree on bids
•	Engage in misleading or false representations to the public.
Associates and their employees must never hold discussions with other competitors, which include other Associates, regarding price, or customers, limiting supply of products, bids, pricing policies and methods, terms of sale, costs, allocation of markets or boycotts of our petroleum products.	•	Remind Associates that it is their responsibility to understand and abide by the law.
•	Guide Associates on where and how to obtain information on the Competition Law.
	•	Familiarize yourself and staff with the Competition Law.
•	Educate staff on proper behaviour and practices.

Personnel and Property Protection Guidelines
Effective Date: March 9, 2016
Last Reviewed by Owner: March 9, 2016

Purpose

Suncor Energy believes 'Crime Prevention Programs' designed to safe-guard people and property is essential. This Security Guidelines Booklet is for use by all Associates and terminal operators and it should be viewed as a tool to assist you in establishing and maintaining a secure environment for your employees and customers.
Security is not the responsibility of any one individual group; rather it requires the combined efforts of you, your staff, the Company and your local law enforcement agency. This united approach together with your leadership will go a long way toward achieving the ultimate in security protection.
All businesses are potential targets for criminals. Your approach to security can make your business less vulnerable to criminal acts. You should make every effort to identify problem areas and minimize opportunities for criminals.
In addition to describing security measures this booklet deals with fuel theft (drive-offs) and other criminal acts which may be directed against your business.
Through prevention programs such as this, we all hope to reduce, or entirely eliminate criminal attacks. Please read this booklet carefully; your time will be well spent.

Security Services














Robbery 
Robbery: is a theft accompanied by violence, threat of violence, use of a weapon or implied use of a weapon. We define robbery and an armed robbery as one in the same.Robbery Prevention MUST be a priority of your business practices. A well trained staff can greatly reduce the threat of robbery. The following preventative measures should become an operating standard of your business.
Preventative Measures
•	NEVER keep large sums of money in the till ( See Cash Control section for recommended amounts) 
	Remove excess money and place it in a safe. 
	Minimize the amount of readily available lottery and tobacco to just what you anticipate you will need after 11pm. The excess should be locked away and out of sight.
•	DON'T clutter windows with displays or signs blocking the view. 
	Allow for a clear view by passing motorists, pedestrians and police patrols.
•	Keep your premises well lit at night (both inside and outside).
•	DON'T answer questions about your business asked by strangers - insist on identification before giving any answers.
•	Pay Attention to suspicious persons loitering around your business, particularly at opening and closing time.
•	Be cautious of anyone seeking entry when you are closed.
•	When making a bank deposit:
	DO NOT carry money in a canvas money bag with the bank's name on it.
	If you must carry money, place the canvas bag inside an unmarked bag and keep it in the trunk of your car
	Vary as much as you can, including time of day, routes, clothing worn, vehicle etc. when making bank deposits. DON'T get into an obvious routine.
•	If you are suspicious do not hesitate to call police

In the event of a robbery there are 4 things the victim should know:
1.	Remain calm
•	Robbers are very tense and may be easily provoked. 
•	The longer a robbery takes the more nervous the robber will become.
•	DON'T ARGUE - once the robbery has started it's too late for robbers to change their minds.
•	DON'T FIGHT - the money / product / or vehicle are not worth the risk of someone being hurt
•	Attacking or resisting a robber does not make you a hero. NEVER try to be a hero.
•	Robbers may resort to violence when they are nervous or startled. Tell the robber about any potential surprises - if someone is in the backroom, or expected soon. 
•	If you must move in any way, tell the robber what you are about to do.

2. Identification
•	Take a good look at the suspect(s), but try NOT to be obvious. Don’t stare. 
•	Notice any details, which will aid you in describing them and their mannerisms.
•	When trying to determine age, height, weight and appearance compare them to yourself or someone you know well.
•	Memorize peculiarities - tattoos, scars, rings, watches, shoes, left-handed or right-handed, and prominent physical features – THINGS THAT WILL NOT CHANGE!
•	Remember type and colour of clothing worn.
•	WEAPON: Describe type, colour and size.
•	If possible, note a full description of the vehicle, if any, and the license number.
•	Direct your employees not to discuss the crime amongst themselves or with witnesses until the police have arrived.
•	Suggest that your employees and any witnesses make notes while the information is still fresh in their minds.

3. After the robber leaves:
•	Notify the police immediately by calling 911, or the Police Emergency number for your area.
•	Give your address, telephone number and name.
•	Remember the details and be as accurate as possible
•	DON'T HANG UP UNTIL ALL THE INFORMATION HAS BEEN GIVEN. 
•	Don't touch anything, stop all business and lock your doors. Preserve any items the suspect may have touched and prevent anyone from going into the area where the suspects were.

4. When the police arrive:
•	Answer their questions as accurately as possible. Tell them only what you saw or know.
•	If you are not sure, say you are not.
•	DON'T exaggerate when describing the suspect or what has been taken. Co-operate with police assigned to the case.

Employees must notify their supervisor immediately following the robbery.
NOTIFY YOUR SUNCOR ENERGY REPRESENTATIVE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ROBBERY
WHILE COOPERATION MAY NOT ALWAYS RESULT IN THE RECOVERY OF YOUR LOSSES, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM BECOMING VICTIMS.

How Best to Protect Your Property
'Clean and well lit premises will alter criminal activity'. Bright lights are a self-protection measure. Nothing deters robbers and burglars more than having to operate in bright light.
Lights 
•	The ideal situation - both from a security standpoint and for customer appeal - would be to flood your whole business premises in a sea of light.
•	The areas which are most vulnerable to the criminal and, therefore, should receive special lighting attention are:
	Entrances - all entry points.
	The yard.
	Rear of the building.
	Office - night light inside the building and over the safe.
Locks 
'Good locks will deter many potential break & enter (B&E) efforts'.
Break & Enter (B&E): is the unlawful entry into a premise for the purpose of committing an offence (usually theft or damage to property). This ONLY occurs in a site that is closed, i.e. a non 24 hr. site. Entry into a locked room such as an office or locked or open vehicle is NOT a Break in but a theft.
•	Install one inch deadbolt locks on all outside doors, and double cylinder, long-throw deadbolts on doors with glass panels.
•	Control of keys is important.
•	Make sure padlocks are solidly mounted and never left open - even on an open door. This practice will prevent key duplication.
•	Change locks when a key is lost.
•	Don't lock a burglar inside when you leave. Inspect all closets, washrooms and other hiding places before locking your business up.



Doors 
•	Metal lining on exterior doors resists drilling and sawing.
•	Bars in the inside of doors prevent breaking the entire door and thus easy entry.
•	Check door frames for looseness, rotting, or expansion capabilities
•	Install non-removable hinge pins on doors that swing outward
•	Routinely ensure that all doors are locked at closing time.
•	ALL 24 hr. self service locations MUST have the main entrance electronically controlled by means of a magnetic or striker type lock mechanism activated from the area of the point of sale 

Windows 
'Windows should offer light, ventilation and visibility. Not easy access.
•	Check window frames for looseness or rotting, and that the window locks work.
•	All windows should be clear of obstruction, to allow for clear visibility into and out of the building.

Alarms 
For sites that operate less than 24 hrs a day, "An adequate alarm system provides constant attention".
•	Alarms have a psychological value - they may scare the burglar or robber away. However, the installation of an alarm system can be expensive; the potential worth of an alarm system should be governed by the size of the inventory, location of the business, and the availability of local law enforcement people to answer the alarm.
•	If your site has a history of Break ins, consideration should be given to a “cellular back up” alarm that will transmit the alarm even if telephone lines are cut.
•	You might get a lower insurance rate if an alarm system is installed.
•	Advertise that your station is equipped with an alarm.
•	Ensure that all your staff are properly trained in alarm procedures. This will eliminate false alarms.

Cash Registers / SAFES 
•	Minimize cash on hand with frequent, irregular safe drops
•	All sites must now have 3  safe compartments, 2 of which have time delay opening (each with a MINIMUM 2 minute delay ) they are :
•	1 -An approved time delay opening, drop safe is now mandatory at all sites
•	2 - All sites MUST have a time delay “coin” safe or compartment for the storage of coin, small bills, lottery and the like. ALL staff members MUST have access to the “coin” safe. It is strongly recommended that no more than $500 in small bills or coin be kept in this safe.  This safe MUST be kept locked at all times when not in immediate use. Hiding money is NOT permitted under any circumstances.
•	3 - All sites MUST now have a  “Cash In Transit” safe for use should the site opt for armoured car cash pick up. If the site does not opt for CIT, the compartment may be used to store other valuable items.
•	 ALL safes must be securely anchored to the floor, wall, other solid structure or millwork and located as close to the Paypoint as possible.
•	Strictly limit the number of people having access to the keys or the safe combination for the primary drop and CIT safes. In British Columbia and Saskatchewan when a GSA is working alone after 11PM, these keys and/or combination for the drop and CIT safes must NOT be available.
•	After store hours, leave empty cash drawers open. This will prevent unnecessary damage from a burglar hunting for cash

These are recommended MAXIMUM amounts for Safe Drops and Cash Floats. Feel free to ‘drop’ smaller amounts. With the new “Coin safes” your site should be able to operate using lower amounts, please consider it for security and safety reasons.
•	Safe Drop - Day - $100.00
•	Safe Drop - Night - $50.00
•	Cash Float - $75.00

Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) 
Each location should have a closed circuit television (CCTV) system. The objectives of such a system are:
•	To deter a criminal.
•	To capture an image of the criminal, should an incident occur.
•	A CCTV system includes cameras (both internally and externally), monitors, and a DVR in a locked office or container.
•	There are recommended specifications for the quantity and location of equipment at each size of store.
•	Ensure that your DVR is recording and saving at least 30 days of footage.  If there are any issues with it contact your service provider for technical support.

Theft Preventive Measures
Theft: is the removal of property from its lawful owner without his/her consent and WITHOUT the use of a weapon, force or threat.
Theft can occur in various ways, ranging from bad cheques, use of stolen credit cards, card skimming, shoplifting, fuel theft (drive-off) occurrences and internal thefts (cash, inventory, etc.) This section will attempt to outline preventative measures against the various forms of theft.
Fuel Theft (Drive-off):  Driving away from the pump without paying is theft. 
In an accidental fuel theft (drive-off), the person believes they have paid for the transaction, but the transaction is incomplete. In an intentional fuel theft (drive-off), the person knows they are committing a crime, but feels there is little risk.
The following measures can be taken to help reduce the incidence of this type of crime.

Fuel Theft (Drive-off) Prevention Measures 
•	Stay Alert. Maintain high visibility to pump island and driveways.
•	Pay special attention to those Guests who approach the far pumps, especially when the station is busy.
•	Make eye contact with the Guest when activating pumps and/or greet Guest at Paypoint. Being visible to all Guests and greeting them will discourage theft.
•	Monitor the pump island for CRIND confusion. Guests may be uncomfortable with the CRIND and may not know if they have correctly completed a transaction. If they are confused or frustrated, they are your potential accidental fuel theft (drive-off) thief.
•	Use intercom at self-serve, if appropriate, to help Guests having problem with the CRIND.

Fuel Theft (Drive-off) thief characteristics
•	The fuel thief will wait until the Paypoint operator is busy with other Guests on the site.
•	The thief will usually drive up to the pumps which are furthest away from the view of Paypoint operator.
•	The license plate on the car may be covered with a rag or black plastic garbage bag, which is partially sticking out from the closed trunk of the car. The plates could also be muddied to obscure the numbers.
•	The thief may appear nervous, frequently glancing at the Paypoint operator to make sure they are not being given any special attention while at the pumps

When a Fuel Theft (Drive-off) occurs 
•	DO NOT under any circumstances chase after the vehicle.
•	Attempt to get the license number.
•	Get a full description of the vehicle and the operator.
•	Note the time and direction the vehicle left the lot.
•	Obtain names and addresses of witnesses (if possible).
•	Immediately call the police

Shoplifting
Shoplifting, in other words, is simply someone trying to take something from the store without actually paying for it.  In most cases, it is something easily concealed in a pocket or the like and is of limited value.  
I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you do NOT attempt to apprehend or detain the suspect. Should you do so, you not only do you put yourself at risk physically should the person become aggressive, you also put yourself at risk of being sued or worse should you be mistaken and / or injure/ assault the suspect in some way.
I recommend that if you observe someone hiding something on their person and they attempt to leave the store, you verbally (from behind the counter or from a safe distance) ask them if they have forgotten to pay for something. As with fuel theft (drive-offs), never chase or physically confront the thief. If the item taken is of some value or the suspect is a repeat offender, attempt to get a good description of the person, vehicle etc, retain the video footage and contact the police. Again NEVER chase or physically confront the suspect.
Conclusion
This booklet provides many ideas and suggestions on how to protect your business and your staff from the criminal. It is primarily designed to set you thinking about the problem of crime prevention and encourage you to take positive action toward formulating an effective crime prevention program for your business. 
Look around the premises and ask yourself: "How secure is it?" "Would it be an easy victim of the robber, the burglar or the thief?"
Asking questions like these is only the beginning. The right answers to these questions are evident in an effective program of crime prevention. Start today, work at it, improve it, and every day ask the question, "Can 1 do more?" You'll be glad you did.

Occupational Health and Safety Awareness and Training Regulation and Acknowledgement Form – Ontario Only
Effective Date: April 4, 2014
Last Reviewed by Owner: May 1, 2015


Purpose:  This site operating procedure (SOP) gives a detailed account of the new regulation requiring health and safety awareness training for every worker and supervisor under Ontario’s Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA). The regulation comes into force July 1, 2014, allowing workplace parties the time to prepare. 

Beginning July 1, 2014, employers in Ontario must ensure that all their workers and supervisors complete a basic occupational health and safety awareness training program.  Besides these new requirements, employers continue to have on-going duties under the OHSA to inform workers about workplace-specific hazards. These include the general duty to “provide information, instruction and supervision to a worker to protect the health or safety of the worker.

Regulatory Requirements under the Occupational Health and Safety Awareness and Training Regulation

Employers must:

•	Ensure that workers complete a basic occupational health and safety awareness training program as soon as reasonably possible;

•	Ensure that supervisors complete a basic occupational health and safety awareness training program within one week of working as a supervisor;

•	Maintain a record of the training completed by workers and supervisors (refer to the Occupational Health and Safety Awareness Training Acknowledgement Form found on the last page of this SOP). This form is to be kept in the Safety and Security section of the Site Actions and Communication Binder – Introduction and Contents;

•	Provide a worker or supervisor with written proof of completion of the training, if requested by the worker or supervisor (up to six months after ceasing to work for the employer). 

Training for Workers

The training program for workers must include instruction on:

•	The duties and rights of workers under OHSA;	
•	The duties of employers and supervisors under OHSA;
•	Common workplace hazards and occupational illnesses;
•	The role of joint health and safety committees (JHSCs) and of health and safety representatives under OHSA;
•	Roles of the ministry, Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB), and Health and Safety Associations; and
Information on and instruction requirements set out in the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) Regulation.

 
Training for Supervisors

The training program for supervisors must include instruction on:

•	The duties and rights of workers under OHSA; 
•	The duties of employers and supervisors under OHSA; 
•	How to identify, assess and manage workplace hazards, the role of joint health and safety committees (JHSCs), and of health and safety representatives under OHSA; 
•	Roles of the ministry, Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB), and Health and Safety Associations; and 
•	Sources of information on occupational health and safety.
Resources and Tools for Employers and other Workplace Parties
The Ministry of Labour provides a number of resources and tools to help employers and other workplace parties comply with the requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Awareness and Training Regulation. 
In addition, electronic (e-learning) training tools are available in English and French online for free to help employers comply with the regulation requirements:
•	Worker Health and Safety Awareness in 4 Steps 
•	Supervisor Health and Safety Awareness in 5 Steps 
The Worker and Supervisor modules above take 30 to 40 minutes to complete. They contain videos and simple quizzes that you cannot skip.  If you answer incorrectly, you will simply be provided with the correct answer and can move on to the next section. You will receive a "Proof of Completion" certificate once you complete the training. You must save and print the certificate before exiting the module. The Ministry of Labour will not store your certificate or keep a record of training. 

•	Please keep a copy of the certificate in your Employee File.
•	Sign the Occupational Health and Safety Awareness Training Acknowledgement Form found on the last page of this SOP and store it in the Safety and Security section of the Site Actions and Communication Binder – Introduction and Contents

Next Steps for Associates
1.	Complete the training and print the certificate so you know the material and can answer any questions your staff and/or supervisors may have. 

2.	Start training your existing staff and supervisors today and place their printed certificates in their Employee Files.

3.	This has been added to the document, “New Hire CL” located on the Associate Portal under: Support>Associate Forms>New Hire Checklist and Acknowledgement Form 

4.	Ensure the Occupational Health and Safety Awareness Training Acknowledgement Form has been signed by all staff and placed in the Site Actions and Communication Binder – Introduction and Contents

Note:  This will be added to the next version of the Safety Evaluation Assessment and Food Service Advisors will be checking the Site Actions and Communication Binder – Introduction and Contents but ultimately, Associates are responsible for keeping up to date on labour and government legislation requirements.
